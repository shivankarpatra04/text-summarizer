      "Operations Management: Oil and Gas Report Introduction Operations management is a branch of management that deals with the designing and supervision of operational processes in a business organization. Operations management covers the responsibility over all processes that involve the production of goods and services as well as the delivery of such productions to the final consumers. Operations management ensures “effective management of resources and activities that produce or deliver goods and services of any business” (Sox 1). Operations management therefore involves the management of “people, materials, equipments and information resources that a business may need” (Sox 1) in its daily activities. History of Operations Management The history of operations management stems all the way back to the eighteenth century. Operations management is however still on its development with focus being made on its elements such as “market focus, globalization, quality management systems, supply chain management and business process analysis, improvement or reengineering” (Business 1) among others. The developments were later enhanced by establishment of mass production approach in operations, quality management and the later developments in technology that enriched the operations management department towards the end of the twentieth century (Khanna 8). Factors Affecting Development of Operations Management Operations management has, along its, history been characterized with a lot of changes that have ensured its evolution over time to its current level. Principles of Operations Management With the main aim of operations management being the improvement in processes in an organization, the management applies a number of approaches to achieving its objectives. Principles of operations management are applicable through the management system in accordance with the sub departments of operations management. Functions of Operations Management The fundamental role of the operations management is to ensure that it understands the whole operation process for an effective management of the activities that are involved. Measures to establish and drive operations to improvements lies with the operations management (Rowbotham, Azhashemi and Galloway 8). In pursuit of these objectives, operations management in any given organization has responsibilities that include “planning, organizing, staffing, leading, and controlling” elements in the organization’s production processes (Haynes 4). In consideration of market trends and in liaison with other departments, whether in the organization or external consultants, the operations management makes plans for timely productions that will ensure customers satisfaction as well as the correct commodities and brands according to market needs (Haynes 6). According to Elearn, planning and control is a necessity for the operations management following the process of designing operations in an organization. The organizational duty of operations management that covers decisions as to how operations are to be undertaken offers directions as to “what task will be done, where, when, and by whom” (Langabeer 1 6). Strategies in operations management are therefore those approaches that are implemented by the management in its functions such as planning, organization and control among others. Since the aim of management strategies is to make improvements in processes and results, strategies often outline changes that are necessary to help the management and the entire organization to achieve its goals. Strategies therefore provides for the identification of steps that needs to be taken by the management and the implementation of such steps to the attainment of the objectives and functions of operations management (Lowson 4 2). Operations management also outlines strategies for controlling production costs of its processes which is made through provisions for the production chain. Objectives of Operations Management It has been established that operations management is charged with specific duties in an organization that relates to the production of goods and services. With the dual purpose of ensuring customer satisfaction and reducing the costs incurred in resources, the central goal of the operations management thus remains to be the balancing of the two concepts, customer satisfaction and costs in resources, in order to satisfy the interest of both its organization in terms of profitability and that of customers in terms of timely and cost friendly deliveries (Kumar 1 3). Operations Management in Oil and Gas Industry In the supply chain of oil and gas for example, the operations activities starts with explorations for availability of the petroleum resources by experts. The operations processes in the supply chain of oil and gas faces a lot of factors that calls for the application of the management to create a balance between consumer satisfaction in terms of pricing and organization’s profitability in the long run. Advantages and Disadvantages of Operations Management Operations management derives a lot of benefits to an organization through the application of the functions of operation managers.\n",
